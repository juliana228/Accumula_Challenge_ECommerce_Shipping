        <pre>npm install</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
        Next, you'll want to create a file titled <b>.env</b> to hold the MongoDB URI. Name your key <b>MONGO_DB_URI</b> and insert database URI.
        </li>
        <li>
        Next, run the following command to spin up application (this program runs on localhost:3000 and localhost:8080 so ensure that no other programs are running on these ports!)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>If product details are not loading on the page, refresh or restart the application by killing both localhost:3000 and localhost:8080 and running 
    <pre>npm run dev</pre>
    </p>
